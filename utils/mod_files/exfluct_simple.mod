TITLE Fluctuating excitatory conductance

COMMENT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This file models fluctuating excitatory conductance (nominal AMPA synaptic input).
	To use it, set the g_e0 and std_e variables.

	To drive the synaptic conductance using a waveform
		http://www.neuron.yale.edu/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2475

		Two tasks are to be performed:
		1. read time stream data from a file into a pair of Vectors--one for the series of conductance values, the other for the corresponding times
		2. arrange for the conductance values to be played into the desired target variable at the appropriate times

		Task 1 (reading data from a file) is straightforward to do with the File and Vector classes. Assuming the data file format is
		t0 g0
		t1 g1
		etc.
		where each tg pair specifies the conductance g at a particular time t, you could use the example provided by this item in the "Hot tips" area of the Forum--
		How to read numerical values from a file
		I'd call the vectors gvec and tvec.

		Then, if you have a point process that has some variable g that you want to drive with the waveform data (assuming that the point process is already attached to a section and is referenced by an objref called pp, and the )--
		gvec.play(&pp.g, tvec, 1)
		Notice the third argument is 1. This is the "continuous" argument; you should read about it in the Programmer's Reference discussion of the Vector class's play method.
